\section{Setup}

First we generated the toy dataset of 10000 rows. As we were coding this homework in \texttt{Python}, we had to write the \texttt{toy\_data} and the \texttt{log\_loss} functions from scratch.

\subsection{A proxy for true risk}

We generated 100.000 rows of data and stated that it is enough, to safely reduce the error to the first decimal digit. This is because the data is generated from normal distribution (each column of the data). 

\section{Holdout estimation}

\subsection{Model loss estimator variability due to test data variability}

\subsection{Overestimation of the deployed model’s risk}

\subsection{Overestimation of the deployed model’s risk}

\section{Cross-validation}

\subsection{A different scenario}
